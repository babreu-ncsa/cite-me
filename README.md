Instructions on how to cite code from this Github


Any source file that you will find in this GitHub presents a header that contains the following license term:

"This program and the accompanying materials are made available to any individual under the citation condition that follows: On the event that the software is used to generate data that is used implicitly or explicitly for research purposes, proper acknowledgment must be provided in the citations section of publications. This includes both the author's name and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. If you are uncertain about how to do that, please check this page: *URL*. This software cannot be used for commercial purposes in any way whatsoever. Omitting this license when redistributing the code is strongly disencouraged."

This is the page with further clarification on how to cite-me. In general, each GitHub project has a name, which appears in the git url. An appropriate citation would contain my name and the name of the institution that I am working for by the time these codes are being produced, as well as the url to the associated git repo. Here's my suggestion:




B. R. de Abreu, "*Project name*", *---- url to git repo----*. National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), *Year*




- *Project name* is, by default, the title of the README.md file in the main branch of the GitHub repo associated to the project.
- *url to git repo* is.... the URL to the project's repository. 
- *Year* can be checked by looking at the date the last commit was made.

If you are still uncertain about how to cite-me, or concerned about the license terms or copyrights, please do not hesitate to contact me: babreu at illinois dot edu.
